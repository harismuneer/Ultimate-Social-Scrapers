## Important Notes 📑 
Please read these points before purchasing the tool:

- The default language of Facebook should be set to English for this tool to work properly. The interface needs to be in English, the post text and all other data can be scraped in any language :)
- If there's any specific use case of yours which the tool doesn't support currently then feel free to send me an email at [haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com) and we will discuss it further.
- This tool is not meant for massive scraping (thousands of posts or friends etc). It might be possible but the rate of scraping would be slower in that scenario.
- Facebook has taken aggressive measures against scraping so sometimes the account you are using to scrape data might get temporarily blocked (though there are some ways to circumvent this issue which I will share during the TeamViewer installation meeting)
