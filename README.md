# Some Notes 🗒️
- The default language should be set to English for this tool to work properly. The interface needs to be in English, **the post text and all other data can be scraped in any language** :)
- If there's any specific use case of yours that the tools don't support currently then feel free to send me an email at [haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com) and we will discuss it further.
- It may be hard to utilize these tools for massive scraping (thousands of posts or friends etc) at a fast pace. It is possible, but the scraping rate would be slower in that scenario.
- Facebook/Instagram/Twitter have taken aggressive measures against scraping so sometimes the account you are using to scrape data might get temporarily blocked (though there are some ways to circumvent this issue which I will share during the installation meeting)

The developers of this software won't be responsible for any misuse of data collected using the social scrapers. These tools have been used by many researchers, marketers, business owners, and open source intelligence (OSINT) analysts.
