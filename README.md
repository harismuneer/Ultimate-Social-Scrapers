## Testimonials 💯 👍
> The best service I got!
I had the pleasure to have a meeting with Haris to learn how to use a tool that he created called "UFS". He is a great professional and very friendly, with a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others. His ability to teach and explain the requirements to use the tool was very clear. I Highly recommend working with him!!.
UFS is a great software developed by Haris and excellent service that is worth buying

- Cristóbal V. (Civil Industrial Engineer)

> Superb customer service! Haris continued to update the tool with new functionality after purchase.

- Georg H. (Data Science Researcher)

> Haris was extremely helpful and patient with his instructions as well as helping me understand how his scraper works and the necessities of certain functions and libraries. Very pleased with the program and the professionalism. This inspires me to improve upon it as well as helping me understand web scrapers more. Thank you Haris!

- Suksan S. (Cybersecurity Student)

and many more satisfied customers.. 

## Purchase 🤝 

In order to purchase the tool, please send me an email at <b>[haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com)</b> and I will help you further. The original price is 199$ but I am offering a special discounted price of <b>179$</b> these days. <i><b>The discounted price is valid only till Jan 18, 2021.</b></i> The purchase includes a one-on-one <b>TeamViewer meeting</b> through which I will install this tool on your computer, train you on its usage and share best practices for scraping. 

## Important Notes 📑 
Please read these points before purchasing the tool:

- The default language of Facebook should be set to English for this tool to work properly.
- If there's any specific use case of yours which the tool doesn't support currently then feel free to send me an email at [haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com) and we will discuss it further.
- This tool is not meant for massive scraping (thousands of posts or friends etc). It is possible but the rate of scraping would be slower in that scenario.
- Facebook has taken aggressive measures against scraping so sometimes the account you are using to scrape data might get temporarily blocked (though there are some ways to circumvent this issue which I will share during the TeamViewer installation meeting)

For more details, read the [FAQ](./FAQ.md)

If you liked the repo then kindly support it by giving it a star ⭐ and share in your circles so more people can benefit from the effort.
